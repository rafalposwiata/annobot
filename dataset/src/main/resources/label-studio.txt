Without a doubt, one of Tobe Hoppor's best! Epic storytellng, great special effects, and The Spacegirl (vamp me baby!).
Read the book, forget the movie!
This movie is terrible but it has some good effects.
If you like Pauly Shore, you'll love Son in Law. If you hate Pauly Shore, then, well...I liked it!
A touching movie. It is full of emotions and wonderful acting. I could have sat through it a second time.
You may like Tim Burton's fantasies, but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes. It demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace.
The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful. It's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil.
Absolutely fantastic! Whatever I say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves. Watch it now! FANTASTIC!
