This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It is not funny. It is not interesting and should not have been made.
This movie will always be a Broadway and Movie classic, as long as there are still people who sing, dance, and act.
If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it.
Brilliant. Ranks along with Citizen Kane, The Matrix and Godfathers. Must see, at least for basset in her early days. Watch it.
Despite its interesting premise, 'Sniper' is quite tedious. With a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying; instead it plods along with little tension.
One of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear! Rather risqu√© for 1931!
This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet. Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments.
I wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night.
