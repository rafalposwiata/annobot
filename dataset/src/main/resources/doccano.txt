I hope this group of film-makers never re-unites.
This movie turned out to be better than I had expected it to be. Some parts were pretty funny. It was nice to have a movie with a new plot.
This is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made. The script is unfunny and the acting stinks. The exact opposite of the original.
This is the greatest movie ever. If you have written it off with out ever seeing it. You must give it a second try.
The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from Gary Busey. Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.
What a waste of talent. A very poor, semi-coherent, script cripples this film. Rather unimaginative direction, too. Some VERY faint echoes of _Fargo_ here, but it just doesn't come off.
This is a terrible movie, don't waste your money on it. Don't even watch it for free. That's all I have to say.
One of the funniest movies made in recent years. Good characterization, plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic
