Totally forgettable and almost unwatchable. If you enjoy bad acting, thin plots and predictably weak outcomes, pull up a chair. Of passing interest to see Bridget Fonda look-a-like Suzy Amis.
This is a very cool movie. The ending of the movie is a bit more defined than the play's ending, but either way it is still a good movie.
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie. Bad characters, bad story and bad acting. It would be a love story between a man and a mermaid. Really awful.
This movie is so bad it's almost good. Bad story, bad acting, bad music, you name it. O.K., who are the jokers that gave this flick a '10'?
A great film in its genre, the direction, acting, most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful. A must see.
Great cast, great acting, great music. Each character in this movie had their own stories and personalities and it's vivid. A great movie not to be missed.
At least the jingle by Tim Finn was melodic. Roberts is the his usual inept self. Characters are inconsistent, dull, purposeless. Roberts changes his accent even within one line.
Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch.
